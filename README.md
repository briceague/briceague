## Hi there 👋

Growing up, I’ve always been a creative and orderly person, which naturally led me down the path to mathematics and computer science. My creative aspect allows me to embrace new ideas whereas my orderly nature pulls me towards always finding the right answer. My unique traits and fondness for mathematics and computer science is what made this course the perfect choice for me. 

I am currently pursuing a degree in mathematics and computer science, and by doing this my enthusiasm for these subject continue to grow and flourish. I have also completed a data science course with HyperionDev, finishing 5th in my class. This course I took deepened my understanding of how complex data can be analysed and interpreted to provide meaningful insights that is easily.

Throughout my schooling career I have been placed into numerous leadership roles which have enriched my academic journey. I served as a prefect in primary and high school and was the deputy representative leader of my high school. 

The great pleasure and fulfilment I receive from solving complex mathematical problems, as well as programming challenges, pushed me to find new opportunities and challenges to grow. I aspire to become a person that has a significant impact in the fields of mathematics and computer science and I am eager to learn as much as I can.
